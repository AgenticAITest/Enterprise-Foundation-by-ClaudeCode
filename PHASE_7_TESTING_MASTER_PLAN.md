## 🎯 **RISK MITIGATION & CONTINGENCY PLANS**

### **Technical Risks**
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| MCP Playwright setup issues | Medium | High | Fallback to standard Playwright with manual context management |
| Performance degradation during parallel testing | High | Medium | Implement queue management and resource throttling |
| Memory leaks in long-running crawls | Medium | Medium | Add periodic context cleanup and garbage collection |
| Network timeout during fuzzing | High | Low | Implement retry logic and timeout handling |

### **Implementation Risks**
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Complex permission matrix validation | Medium | High | Break down into smaller test chunks, use visual validation |
| Security payload false positives | High | Medium | Implement context-aware analysis and manual verification |
| Browser compatibility issues | Low | Medium | Test on multiple browsers, document compatibility requirements |
| Test data corruption | Low | High | Database snapshots before testing, automated data restoration |
