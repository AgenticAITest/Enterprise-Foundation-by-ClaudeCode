  Features:
  - Hide sensitive fields based on permissions
  - Mask data (e.g., show "***" instead of salary)
  - Field-level read/write permissions
  - Dynamic form field rendering
  - Integration with existing forms

  5.3.6 Module-Specific Dashboards (2-3 hours)

  Priority: Medium - User experience enhancement
  Description: Customizable dashboards per module with permission-aware widgets
  Components to build:
  - ModuleDashboard.tsx: Main dashboard component
  - DashboardWidget.tsx: Individual widget component
  - useModuleDashboard.tsx: Hook for dashboard configuration
  - DashboardProvider.tsx: Context for dashboard state

  Features:
  - Module-specific dashboard layouts
  - Permission-aware widget rendering
  - Customizable widget arrangements
  - Real-time data updates
  - Export/print dashboard functionality

  üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Approach

  Architecture Strategy:

  1. Context-First Design: Use React Context for global state management
  2. Hook-Based Logic: Custom hooks for reusable permission logic
  3. Component Composition: Composable components for flexible UI building
  4. Performance Optimization: Memoization and caching for permission checks
  5. Type Safety: Full TypeScript integration with existing types

  Integration Points:

  - Existing Components: Integrate with Phase 5.2 components
  - Backend APIs: Use existing permission APIs from Phase 3
  - State Management: Extend existing TenantAdminProvider
  - Routing: Enhance React Router with permission checks

  Development Order:

  1. 5.3.1 ‚Üí 5.3.2: Core navigation (foundation)
  2. 5.3.3: Permission gates (security layer)
  3. 5.3.4 ‚Üí 5.3.5: Data controls (data security)
  4. 5.3.6: Dashboard (user experience)

  ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

  Functional Requirements:

  - Users only see modules/features they have access to
  - Navigation adapts dynamically to permission changes
  - Data is automatically filtered based on user's scope
  - Sensitive fields are masked/hidden appropriately
  - Module dashboards show relevant widgets only

  Non-Functional Requirements:

  - Permission checks complete within 100ms
  - UI remains responsive during permission evaluation
  - Graceful fallbacks for permission failures
  - Consistent visual indicators for restricted content
  - Accessibility compliance maintained

  Security Requirements:

  - No client-side permission bypassing possible
  - Permission checks validated server-side
  - Sensitive data never sent to unauthorized users
  - Audit logging for permission-related actions
  - Session timeout handling for permissions

  üéØ Expected Outcomes

  After completing Phase 5.3, users will have:
  - Seamless Navigation: Only see what they can access
  - Enhanced Security: Multi-layered permission enforcement
  - Better UX: Contextual interfaces based on their role
  - Data Protection: Automatic scope-based filtering
  - Personalized Experience: Module-specific customizations

  Estimated Timeline: 12-15 hours total
  Components Created: ~15 new components + hooks
  Integration: Full integration with existing Phase 5.2 components

  This phase will complete the user-facing experience and make the RBAC system fully operational from an end-user perspective.
